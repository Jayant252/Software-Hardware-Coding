# Integration of 32-bit RISC-V ALU and ARM via Simple Bus with Scan Testability

This project demonstrates a hardware-software co-design that integrates a 32-bit RISC-V ALU with an ARM Cortex core using a custom Simple Bus interface. It also features scan testability via a scan chain model.

## üìå Overview

The system is built on the ZedBoard (ARM Cortex A9), where a custom peripheral (32-bit RISC-V ALU) is implemented using SystemC. Communication between the ARM core and the ALU is handled via a custom-designed Simple Bus. The system also incorporates a scan chain to enable efficient design-for-testability (DFT).

## üß† Key Features

- **32-bit RISC-V ALU** with support for AND, OR, ADD, SUB, SLT operations
- **Simple Bus Interface** between ARM core and ALU registers
- **Scan Chain Implementation** using TDI/TDO with test mode activation
- **Modular Design** in SystemC with BPI (Bus Peripheral Interface)
- **Flag Generation**: Zero, Less Than, Negative, etc.
- **ZedBoard Integration**: Read/write from ARM to control switches and LEDs

## üìê System Architecture

- **Registers**: 7 general-purpose 32-bit registers (operands, opcode, result, flags, LEDs, switches)
- **ALU**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations based on opcode
- **Simple Bus**: Custom synchronous bus for ARM-register-ALU communication
- **Scan Chain**: Provides observability and controllability for each register through serial TDI/TDO shifting

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- SystemC (hardware modeling)
- C++ (SystemC modules and testbench)
- ZedBoard (ARM Cortex-A9 based FPGA)
- TAP Test Model (IEEE 1149.1 inspired)

### ALU Operations
| Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Opcode | Result     | Flags                  |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|------------------------|
| 5         | 4         | AND    | 4          | -                      |
| 1         | 2         | OR     | 3          | -                      |
| 5         | 6         | ADD    | 11         | Less Than Flag         |
| 8         | 9         | SUB    | -1 (FFFF)  | Less Than, Negative    |
| 3         | 4         | SLT    | 1 (True)   | Less Than Flag         |

### Scan Chain Test
- Parallel input and output through 32-bit registers
- TDI loaded serially and shifted to TDO
- Debug mode enabled through print statements


## üß™ How to Run

1. Ensure SystemC is installed.
2. Compile using a SystemC-compatible build tool (Makefile/CMake).
3. Run `main.cpp` to simulate data writes, ALU operations, and scan chain activity.
4. Use debug print flags to trace each operation.
